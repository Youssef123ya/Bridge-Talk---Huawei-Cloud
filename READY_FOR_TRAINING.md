## 🚀 YOUR NEXT ACTIONS (Step-by-Step)

### IMMEDIATE: Wait for Dataset Upload

**Current:** 54K/108K images uploaded (1.9%)  
**Action:** Let upload complete (1-2 hours remaining)  
**Check:** https://console.huaweicloud.com/obs → `arsl-youssef-af-cairo-2025`

---

### STEP 1: Upload Training Code to OBS (5 minutes)

Once dataset upload is complete:

1. **Go to OBS Console:**
   ```
   🌐 https://console.huaweicloud.com/obs
   ```

2. **Navigate to your bucket:**
   - Bucket: `arsl-youssef-af-cairo-2025`
   - Create folder: `code/`

3. **Upload training script:**
   - File: `scripts/train_arsl.py` (from your local computer)
   - Destination: `obs://arsl-youssef-af-cairo-2025/code/train_arsl.py`

✅ **Verify:** File should show in `code/` folder with size ~12 KB

---

### STEP 2: Create ModelArts Training Job (15 minutes)

1. **Open ModelArts Console:**
   ```
   🌐 https://console.huaweicloud.com/modelarts
   ```

2. **Create Training Job:**
   - Training Management → Training Jobs → **Create Training Job**

3. **Follow the detailed guide:**
   - Open: `MODELARTS_TRAINING_GUIDE.md`
   - Section: "STEP 2: Create ModelArts Training Job"
   - Fill in all configuration exactly as specified

**Quick Config Summary:**
```
Job Name: arsl-recognition-training-v1
Code: obs://arsl-youssef-af-cairo-2025/code/
Boot File: train_arsl.py
AI Engine: PyTorch 1.8.0-python3.7
GPU: V100 32GB (1 node)
Input: obs://arsl-youssef-af-cairo-2025/datasets/raw/
Output: obs://arsl-youssef-af-cairo-2025/output/
```

**Hyperparameters (add all 8):**
- batch_size: 64
- learning_rate: 0.001  
- epochs: 100
- num_classes: 32
- image_size: 64
- validation_split: 0.2
- patience: 15
- random_seed: 42

---

### STEP 3: Monitor Training (4-7 hours)

1. **Check job status in ModelArts console**
2. **View real-time logs** (every 30-60 minutes)
3. **Watch for key metrics:**
   - Training accuracy increasing
   - Validation accuracy > 85%
   - Loss decreasing steadily

**Expected Timeline:**
```
0-15 min:    Job setup and resource allocation
15-30 min:   Data loading
30 min-4 hr: Training (epochs 1-80)
4-5 hr:      Final epochs and validation
5-7 hr:      Model saving and completion
```

---

### STEP 4: Verify Completion

1. **Check job status:** Should show "Completed" (green)
2. **Verify output files in OBS:**
   - `obs://arsl-youssef-af-cairo-2025/output/best_model.pth`
   - `obs://arsl-youssef-af-cairo-2025/output/training_history.json`
3. **Review final metrics:** Val accuracy > 85%

---

### STEP 5: Proceed to API Deployment

Once training is complete with good accuracy:

```bash
# Phase 4: Deploy your trained model as API
python scripts/phase4_step1_import_model.py
python scripts/phase4_step2_inference_service.py
python scripts/phase4_step3_api_gateway.py
python scripts/phase4_step4_monitoring.py
python scripts/phase4_step5_api_testing.py
```

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Common Issues

**Q: Dataset upload taking too long?**
A: Normal for 108K images. Let it complete fully before training.

**Q: Can't find V100 GPU option?**
A: Try P100 GPU instead, or check if you have GPU quota in AF-Cairo region.

**Q: Training job fails immediately?**
A: Check logs in ModelArts console. Verify OBS paths and training script are correct.

**Q: Low accuracy (<70%)?**
A: Verify dataset quality, check class balance, review training logs for errors.
