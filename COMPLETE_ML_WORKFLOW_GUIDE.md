# 🎯 Complete ML Workflow Guide - Arabic Sign Language Recognition

## 📊 Based on Your System Architecture Diagram

### Current Status: Phase 2 (Dataset Upload) - 1.9% Complete

---

## 🔄 Complete Workflow (As Per Your Diagram)

### **PHASE 1: Data Preparation** ✅ DONE
**ML Engineer → OBS Storage**
- ✅ Upload new training data to OBS bucket
- ✅ OBS bucket: `arsl-youssef-af-cairo-2025`
- ⏳ 54,072 of 108,098 images uploaded (1-2 hours remaining)

**Action:** Wait for upload to complete or check status:
```bash
python scripts/monitor_upload.py
```

---

## 🚀 PHASE 2: Training Configuration & Execution

### Step 2.1: Configure Training Job
**ML Engineer → ModelArts Platform**

After dataset upload completes, configure your training job:

```bash
python scripts/configure_training.py
```

**This will:**
- Load datasets from OBS
- Configure PyTorch training environment
- Set up distributed training (multi-GPU)
- Define model architecture for 32 Arabic sign classes

### Step 2.2: Create ModelArts Training Job
**ModelArts → OBS Storage**

```bash
python scripts/create_modelarts_job.py
```

**ModelArts will:**
- Load datasets + previous models (if any)
- Start distributed training with multi-GPU
- Perform automated evaluation during training
- Store model artifacts + metrics back to OBS

### Step 2.3: Monitor Training
**Track training progress in real-time:**

```bash
python scripts/monitor_training.py
```

**Monitor:**
- Training loss and accuracy
- Validation metrics
- Resource utilization (GPU/Memory)
- Estimated completion time

---

## 🎭 PHASE 3: Model Evaluation & Canary Release

### Decision Point: Model Performance Check

**If [Model meets performance criteria]:**
→ Proceed to Canary Deployment

**Criteria to check:**
- Accuracy > 95%
- Loss < 0.1
- Validation accuracy stable
- No overfitting detected

**Check with:**
```bash
python scripts/check_phase3_status.py
```

### Step 3.1: Deploy Model (Canary Release)
**ModelArts → VIAS Service**

```bash
python scripts/phase4_step1_import_model.py  # Import model to VIAS
python scripts/phase4_step2_inference_service.py  # Deploy inference endpoint
```

**VIAS will:**
- Load model artifacts from OBS
- Initialize inference endpoint
- Start with limited traffic (canary)
- Track performance metrics

---

## 📈 PHASE 4: Production Deployment & Monitoring

### Decision Point: Performance Validation

**If [Performance acceptable]:**
→ Promote to full production

**If [Performance degraded]:**
→ Rollback to previous version

### Step 4.1: Full Production Deployment

```bash
python scripts/phase4_step3_api_gateway.py  # Configure API Gateway
python scripts/phase4_step4_monitoring.py   # Setup monitoring
```

**This configures:**
- Public API endpoint via API Gateway
- Authentication and rate limiting
- Performance monitoring
- Alert notifications

### Step 4.2: Test API Endpoints

```bash
python scripts/phase4_step5_api_testing.py
```

**Tests:**
- API availability and response times
- Model prediction accuracy
- Load handling
- Error rate monitoring

---

## 🔍 PHASE 5: Continuous Monitoring

**Monitoring System tracks:**
- Performance metrics (response time, throughput)
- Model accuracy on production data
- System resource utilization
- Error rates and anomalies

**Access monitoring:**
- Cloud Eye Dashboard: https://console.huaweicloud.com/ces
- Custom metrics via `scripts/arsl_monitor.py`
- Real-time alerts via SMS/Email

### Automated Actions:

**If performance degrades:**
→ Automatic rollback to previous version

**If performance acceptable:**
→ Continue monitoring and collect feedback for next iteration
